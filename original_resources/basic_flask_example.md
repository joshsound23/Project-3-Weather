Creating a 3-visualization dashboard using Flask as your web framework and SQLite as your database can be a great project. Here's a general outline of how you can structure your Flask application to achieve this:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Flask Application

First, you'll need to create a basic Flask application. Install Flask if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

Then, set up your Flask application structure:

```plaintext
/YourApp
    /static
        /css
        /js
    /templates
        dashboard.html
    app.py
    db.sqlite
```

In `app.py`, set up the basic Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('dashboard.html')

# ... more code will go here ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Step 2: Create the Database

You'll need a SQLite database (`db.sqlite`) to store your data. You can create and populate your database using SQLite commands. Ensure your data is structured in a way that's conducive to the visualizations you intend to create.

### Step 3: Create an API Endpoint

Now, create an API endpoint in your Flask application that queries the SQLite database, retrieves data, and returns it as JSON:

```python
@app.route('/api/data')
def get_data():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('db.sqlite')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Example query - adjust according to your data schema
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
    data = cursor.fetchall()

    conn.close()
    return jsonify(data)
```

### Step 4: Building the Dashboard

In your `dashboard.html` file within the `/templates` directory, you'll create the HTML structure for your dashboard. This is where you'll also include JavaScript to make requests to your API endpoint and render the visualizations.

You might use a JavaScript library like D3.js, Chart.js, or any other depending on your preference for creating visualizations.

Example JavaScript code to fetch data from your API:

```javascript
d3.json('/api/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Logic to render visualization with the data
    });
```

### Step 5: CSS and Additional Styling

Use the `/static/css` folder to store your CSS files. Link these in your `dashboard.html` to style your dashboard.

### Step 6: Running Your Application

Run your Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` in your web browser to see your dashboard.

### Additional Tips:

- Test your API endpoint separately to make sure it returns the correct data.
- Consider security practices like SQL injection prevention.
- Ensure your JavaScript correctly parses and utilizes the JSON data from the Flask endpoint.
- If your visualizations are complex, consider modularizing your JavaScript code for better maintainability.

This is a basic structure to get you started. Depending on your exact requirements, you might need to adjust or expand certain parts of the application.
